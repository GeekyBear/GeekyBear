- 👋 Hi, I’m @GeekyBear.
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a superhero, but well, you know, I can't... I couldn't get one of those genetically modified super spiders so... I'll work for food (joke). I'm trying to get my first job in Development, I want to grow professionally and learn everyday.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript at SoyHenry. I'm studying to become a Full Stack Developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on every oportunity I get to improve my knowledge and expertise.
- 📫 How to reach me at => email: ezegeek@gmail.com
